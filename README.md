# 💫 About Me:
I’m a motivated Computer Science Engineering student at KL University with a strong academic background (CGPA: 9.02) and a growing interest in cloud infrastructure design, cybersecurity, and system architecture. I enjoy coding and solving problems, and I’m comfortable working with C, C++, Java, Python, SQL, and web technologies while continuously improving my Data Structures and Algorithms skills.

I like understanding how systems work from start to finish — from backend logic to deployment basics, networking fundamentals, and security concepts. I’m actively learning how real-world applications are designed, secured, and scaled.

Along with tech, I enjoy **writing and painting**, which help me express creativity beyond code and maintain balance. I’ve also taken on leadership and PR roles at my university, strengthening my communication and teamwork skills. I’m always curious, always learning, and quietly focused on building strong fundamentals. 🌸
